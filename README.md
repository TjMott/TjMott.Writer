# TjMott.Writer

This is my custom-developed word processor plus extras for writing/authoring as well as storing notes for writing jobs.

# UNFINISHED

NOTE: This software is incomplete! Use at your own risk. The file format is subject to change without warning, and many features are not yet implemented or useful. However this is under active development and I'll update this readme once I hit a releasable state.

# PLATFORM

This application runs on .NET Core 3.1 with a WPF GUI. It requires Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition is fine) to compile.
